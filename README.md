### Poetry

The project is managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). To install poetry, please follow the
[official guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Once Poetry is installed, to create the virtual environment and install the necessary packages, run the following
command from the root of this repo:

```shell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```

This should create a `.venv` directory at the root of the repo.repo.
